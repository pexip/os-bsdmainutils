Description: collection of more utilities from FreeBSD
 This package contains lots of small programs many people expect to find when
 they use a BSD-style Unix system.
 .
 It provides banner (as printerbanner), calendar, col, colcrt, colrm, column,
 from (as bsd-from), hexdump (or hd), look, lorder, ncal (or cal), ul, and
 write (as bsd-write).
 .
 This package used to contain whois and vacation, which are now distributed in
 their own packages. Also here was tsort, which is now in the "coreutils"
 package.
