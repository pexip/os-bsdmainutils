    - support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
    - central configuration file, config.mk
    - installation code moved from debian/rules to other files
  * New upstream release:
    - Make lorder(1) work in a strict POSIX environment. Thanks
      Paul Eggert. (closes: #204907)
    - Cause hexdump to print an error when an invalid value follows
      "-n". (closes: #183345)
    - Add note to calendar.1 about format change. (closes: #178329)
    - Add a calendar with Debian dates. Thanks Martin Schulze.
    - Compile hexdump with support for large files. (closes: #175993)
    - Update all calendar files to the new format. (closes: #178330)
    - Add a final newline to calendar.newzealand.
      (closes: #198086, #208664, #207848)
    - Convert all calendar input data internally to wchar_t, and convert
      that to the user's encoding before outputting. (closes: #194265)
    - Distribute calendar files in UTF-8 and the C locale.
    - Die if locale is unavailable. (closes: #185557)
  * Use OpenBSD calendar(1):
    - Thanks to Matt Zimmerman for the idea.
    - Some options differ between the two versions, but the OpenBSD
      syntax seems cleaner. Also, OpenBSD doesn't support yearly
      calendar directories, and that hasn't been added back yet, as it
      is not currently used.
    - Output is now sorted. (closes: #176742)
    - Shows Labor day correctly. (closes: #207846)
    - Correct problems with cpp search path. (closes: #200814)
    - Thanksgiving on Sunday, not Thursday. (closes: #168681)
    - Don't schedule things for 32 Jan. (closes: #131769)
  * Add a Japanese debconf translation. Thanks Tomohiro KUBOTA.
    (closes: #194642)
